This project uses a KL25Z microcontroller to show how to calculate the ambient temperature using an NTC temperature sensor. It uses the UART to display the temperature readings on a terminal emulator such as Putty or Termite.

For an in-depth description of the project please take a look at the documentation.pdf file.

The source_files folder contains all the .h and .c files required to run the program.
